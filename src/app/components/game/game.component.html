      Thank you very much for your participation in the study!
      <br><br>
      We would like to briefly inform you about the objectives of the study. Please read the following
      information:
      <br><br>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the extent to which contextual understanding influences player performance when guessing words. 
      You were presented with descriptions of words during the course of the game. Half of the descriptions were generated by ChatGPT's artificial intelligence and the other half by humans. 
      We now investigate how game performance differs for ChatGPT-generated descriptions compared to human-generated descriptions. 
      In addition, for single words from the IT domain, we examine how the success rate is related to the technical background of the guessing person.
